# Udacity Capstone Project: MyFriendsRecipeBook

This is my Capstone project, a recipe book for yourself. Right now it stores recipes for oneself, not being able to share them, but this will be added after evaluation of the project.

## Backend
The backend is developed serverless, with the serverless framework in typescript. 

## Frontend
The frontend is developed with VueJs and deployed on an AWS S3 and distributed via cloudfront. 
The starting point was a vuejs template provided Auth0, after that a few plugins were added, most importantly TailwindCSS, because it is lit. :D
